# Docker Compose - Multi Containers App

This is a simple example of how to make MongoDB and EJS App containers communicate with each other using Docker Compose.

Docker-compose is the right tool for you to make containers communication to each other. Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.

You can try it out using the following command.

```docker compose up -d```

And open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
